Yellow diamonds in the light 
And we're standing side by side 
As your shadow crosses mine 
What it takes to come alive 
It's the way I'm feeling 
I just can't deny 
But I've gotta let it go 

We found love in a hopeless place 
We found love in a hopeless place 
We found love in a hopeless place 
We found love in a hopeless place 

Shine a light through an open door 
Love and life I will divide 
Turn away ‘cause I need you more 
Feel the heartbeat in my mind 
It's the way I'm feeling 
I just can't deny 
But I've gotta let it go 

We found love in a hopeless place 
We found love in a hopeless place 
We found love in a hopeless place 
We found love in a hopeless place

Yellow diamonds in the light 
And we're standing side by side 
As your shadow crosses mine 

We found love in a hopeless place 
We found love in a hopeless place 
We found love in a hopeless place 
We found love in a hopeless place

We found love in a hopeless place 
We found love in a hopeless place 
We found love in a hopeless place 
We found love in a hopeless place
